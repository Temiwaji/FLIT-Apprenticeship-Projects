## Overview

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive Market Basket Analysis using Python. Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that identifies the co-occurrence patterns of items in transactions. The primary goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior, uncover associations between different products, and derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Features
Feature Engineering: The dataset is enhanced through feature engineering, involving the grouping of items per customer per day into a 'CustomerTransaction' basket.

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset's structure and characteristics, with a focus on columns such as 'Member_Number,' 'ItemDescription,' and 'Date.'

Apriori Algorithm: Apply the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets, providing a foundation for deriving association rules.

Association Rules Visualization: Visualize the top association rules using a heatmap, particularly focusing on positive associations utilizing Zhang's metric.
